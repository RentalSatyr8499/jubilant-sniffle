# Rubiks Chess
This is an ongoing personal project to create a web-based game that allows you to play chess on a Rubik's cube!

<p style="text-align: center;">Above is the current progress on the project. Working on adding the ability to move pieces next!</p>

This is an exercise in MVC architecture. It uses the THREE.js library for rendering and will probably have a backend on fly.io for multiplayer functionality. I also hope to have an AI player at some point too.

# To run
The project is not currently live so it must be run locally. In jubilant-sniffle/jubilant sniffle, run `npx vite` in your terminal (make sure you're in the directory that includes `index.html`). Then type `o+enter` to open the application in a web browser.
